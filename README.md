# flask_intro_repository

 This was my first ever attempt at creating a website, it used python's flask framework and
 sqlite as a db proxy. It was deployed on heroku. You are not missing much, it looked like a
 2000s blog with very basic posting and post editing functionality. It is no longer maintained
 but serves as the first larger-than-script-sized project I ever completed. It followed in great part
 Corey Schafer's flask tutorials on youtube.
